          Empowering Women, Protecting the Planet As a female-led brand, we are driven by a mission to empower women and protect the environment. At Ekatra, we work with women from diverse and underserved backgrounds—often homemakers with little formal education—giving them the opportunity to gain financial independence and learn new skills in upcycling, recycling, and crafting. Each woman brings her unique story and passion, coming together to create a stronger, more supportive community.Sustainability is at the heart of what we do. We consciously source azo-free, organic cotton and ensure every scrap of material is repurposed—into smaller products, business cards, or recycled paper. Our eco-friendly bamboo paper adds a thoughtful touch to your gifting experience, combining beauty with responsibility.With every product, we strive to empower, uplift, and inspire—creating a meaningful impact for people and the planet.
